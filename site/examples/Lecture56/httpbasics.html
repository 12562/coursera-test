<!-- HTTP basics:
   Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
   Based on request/response stateless protocol
   * Client opens connection to server
   * Client sends HTTP request for a resource
   * Server sends HTTP response to the client with resource or error.
   * Client closes connection to server

  Identifying Resources on the Web:
    i)  URN : Uniform Resource Name
           -> Uniquely identifies resource or name of resource.
           -> Does not tell us how to get the resource.
        * Locally distinguish resources
          eg. /html/css/javascript/web/developers/   

    ii) URI : Uniform Resource Identifier
           -> Uniquely identifies resource or location of resource
           -> Does not necessarily tell us how to get the resource
        
        eg. official_web_site/index.html

    iii) URL : Uniform Resource Locator
        * Form of URI that provides info on how to get resource

        eg. http://www.mysite.com/official_web_site/index.html
